## ℹ️ A Multi-Section Responsive Landing Page

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items:center; gap: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
    <img src="./screenshot1.png" alt="Website screenshot on mobile.">
    <img src="./screenshot2.png" alt="Website screenshot on larger screens.">
</div>

A full landing page for an online course platform, built entirely with semantic HTML5 and custom CSS. This site mimics Tailwind UI-style layouts and practices real-world design structures. It includes metrics, feature highlights, pricing options, testimonials, and an FAQ section — all wrapped in a responsive and accessible layout.

## 🔍 Overview

This is a fully responsive, multi-section landing page inspired by Tailwind UI. Built from a Figma design using semantic HTML and custom CSS, the layout simulates a real-world course platform with clean structure and accessibility in mind.

This project served as a hands-on exercise in building complex layouts from scratch, deepening my understanding of responsive design, mobile-first development, and professional UI/UX patterns — all without using any frameworks.
